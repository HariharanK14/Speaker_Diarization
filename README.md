# Speaker_Diarization1
🎙️ Speaker Diarization for Multilingual Conversations
Effortlessly analyze audio streams by identifying speakers and their transitions across multiple languages. This project revolutionizes speaker diarization by accommodating multilingual environments and language-switching scenarios.

✨ Core Features
🔀 Multilingual Adaptability: Seamlessly handles language transitions during conversations.
🧩 Speaker Identification: Accurately segments speakers within audio streams.
🌍 Language-Aware Diarization: Enhances accuracy by detecting and adapting to language shifts.
📦 Pre-Trained Models: Leverages advanced models from pyannote-audio for precise diarization.
⚡ Scalable Design: Efficiently processes lengthy conversations with overlapping speakers.

⚙️ Workflow
1️⃣ Audio Input: Provide an audio file (e.g., meetings or podcasts) in WAV format.
2️⃣ Speaker Segmentation: The audio is divided into segments based on speaker identity.
3️⃣ Language Detection (Optional): Identifies language transitions to boost segmentation accuracy.
4️⃣ Output Generation: Outputs speaker timestamps, showing "who spoke when" and optionally the language.

🛠️ Installation Steps
1️⃣ Clone Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [https://github.com/Tharunn30/Speaker-Diarization-In-Multilingual-Scenarios.git](https://github.com/HariharanK14/Speaker_Diarization/)  
cd Speaker-Diarization-In-Multilingual-Scenarios  
2️⃣ Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
3️⃣ Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
4️⃣ Download Models:
Follow instructions on pyannote-audio for installing pre-trained models.

🚀 Usage Instructions
1️⃣ Prepare Your Audio: Ensure the file is in WAV format.
2️⃣ Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python diarization.py --audio_file <path_to_audio_file>  
3️⃣ View Results: Outputs include speaker segments with timestamps. Save them as JSON or text for detailed analysis.

Sample Output:

text
Copy code
Speaker A: 00:00 - 00:30  
Speaker B: 00:30 - 01:15  
Speaker A: 01:15 - 02:00
